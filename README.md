Codehaus JIRA issues on GRECLIPSE project  

This repository has the backups for the Groovy-eclipse jira issues in the next formats:  
1. xsl (Excel) - Inside "/excel exports"  folder  
2. xml  
3. xht  
4. html  

Basically, the backup was done on each option that JIRA provided.   

The excel files are separated in multiple files because a JIRA limit on the number of issues per exported file.  
The same strategy was done on the xml, xht and html. But for these formats the issues are separated between:  
1. Open Issues  
2. Closed and Resolved Before 01/01/2011  
3. Closed and Resovled After 01/01/2011  
 
The reason for this split is again a limit in JIRA export function.
